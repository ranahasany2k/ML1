      "In October 2021, we changed our corporate name from Facebook, Inc. to Meta Platforms, Inc. We will not distinguish \n",

      "Form 10-K. As such, unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms \"Meta,\" \"company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \n",

      "3LIMITATIONS OF KEY METRICS AND OTHER DATA\n",
      "The numbers for our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. We \n",
      "have historically reported the numbers of our daily active users (DAUs), monthly active users (MAUs), and average revenue \n",
      "per user (ARPU) (collectively, our \"Facebook metrics\") based on user activity only on Facebook and Messenger and not on \n",
      "our other products. Beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, we also report \n",
      "our estimates of the numbers of our daily active people (DAP), monthly active people (MAP), and average revenue per \n",
      "person (ARPP) (collectively, our \"Family metrics\") based on the activity of users who visited at least one of Facebook, \n",
      "Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) during the applicable period of measurement. \n",
      "We believe our Family metrics better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one \n",
      "of our products. As a result, over time we intend to report our Family metrics as key metrics in place of DAUs, MAUs, and \n",
      "ARPU in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n",
      "While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable \n",
      "period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile \n",
      "populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also \n",
      "susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user \n",
      "base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our \n",
      "processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to \n",
      "improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical \n",
      "metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such \n",
      "adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or \n",
      "adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.\n",
      "In addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties \n",
      "due to differences in methodology.\n",
      "Family Metrics\n",
      "Many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple \n",
      "user accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of \n",
      "user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our \n",
      "Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, \n",
      "and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our \n",
      "Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To \n",
      "calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the \n",
      "individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across \n",
      "multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one \n",
      "person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, \n",
      "and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics \n",
      "primarily based on user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family \n",
      "metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide \n",
      "MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and \n",
      "it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, \n",
      "potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes \n",
      "or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\n",
      "To calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are \n",
      "developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply \n",
      "significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within \n",
      "individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and \n",
      "user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our \n",
      "products, which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and \n",
      "may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations \n",
      "may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. \n",
      "Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals \n",
      "4for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer \n",
      "data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp \n",
      "user accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger Kids users are included in our Family \n",
      "metrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating DAP and \n",
      "MAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own \n",
      "product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations \n",
      "while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or \n",
      "accuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics \n",
      "also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product \n",
      "changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match \n",
      "accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution \n",
      "may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\n",
      "We regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of \"violating\" \n",
      "accounts. We define \"violating\" accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our \n",
      "terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that approximately 3% of our \n",
      "worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of \n",
      "accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and \n",
      "behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have \n",
      "limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or \n",
      "more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have \n",
      "one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product \n",
      "changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP \n",
      "and MAP estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting solely \n",
      "of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that \n",
      "the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.\n",
      "The numbers of Family DAP and MAP discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as ARPP, do not \n",
      "include users on our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other \n",
      "activities on our Family products.\n",
      "Facebook Metrics\n",
      "We regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of \"duplicate\" and \"false\" accounts among our \n",
      "MAUs. A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide \"false\" accounts \n",
      "into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles for a business, organization, \n",
      "or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a Page rather than a personal profile under \n",
      "our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for \n",
      "purposes that violate our terms of service, such as bots and spam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on \n",
      "an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For \n",
      "example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user names, and to \n",
      "identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. \n",
      "Any loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-\n",
      "party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely \n",
      "during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and \n",
      "false accounts. Our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data \n",
      "signals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and \n",
      "may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to \n",
      "measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our \n",
      "estimates.\n",
      "In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our \n",
      "worldwide MAUs. We believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the \n",
      "Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that false \n",
      "accounts may have represented approximately 5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts can vary as a \n",
      "result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries \n",
      "5such as Indonesia, Nigeria, and Vietnam. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take \n",
      "other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAU and \n",
      "MAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts \n",
      "among our MAUs on an annual basis.\n",
      "The numbers of DAUs and MAUs discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as ARPU, do not include \n",
      "users on Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively, \n",
      "based on their other activities on Facebook.\n",
      "User Geography\n",
      "Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP \n",
      "address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a \n",
      "user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the \n",
      "user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical \n",
      "errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors. \n",

      "NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n",
      "Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n",
      "Organization  and Description of Business \n",
      "We were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. In October 2021, we changed our corporate name from Facebook, \n",
      "Inc. to Meta Platforms, Inc. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. \n",
      "All of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life.\n",
      "We report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). The \n",
      "segment information aligns with how the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our Chief Executive Officer \n",
      "(CEO), reviews and manages the business. W e generate substantially  all of our revenue from advertising.\n",
      "Basis of Presentation\n",
      "We prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles \n",
      "(GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where we have \n",
      "controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All \n",
      "intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n",
      "Use of Estimates\n",
      "Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments \n",
      "that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the \n",
      "basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other \n",
      "sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions that we believe are \n",
      "reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not \n",
      "limited to, those related to revenue recognition, valuation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation \n",
      "of long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and their associated estimated useful \n",
      "lives, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, credit losses of accounts receivable, fair value of financial \n",
      "instruments, and leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events and expectations about \n",
      "actions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\n",
      "In connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the \n",
      "estimated average useful lives of selected cohorts of servers and network assets from three years to four years in prior years \n",
      "as well as in 2021 as a result of longer refresh cycles in our data centers. Prior year changes individually or in aggregate did \n",
      "not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. The effect of the 2021 changes was a reduction in \n",
      "depreciation expense of $620 million and an increase in net income of $516 million, or $0.18 per diluted share for the year \n",
      "ended December 31, 2021. The impact from the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the asset bases existing as \n",
      "of the effective dates of the changes and applying the revised estimated useful lives prospectively.\n",
      "Revenue Recognition\n",
      "Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount \n",
      "that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. \n",
      "We determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\n",
      "• identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n",
      "• identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n",
      "• determination of the transaction price;\n",
      "• allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n",
      "• recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\n",
      "85Revenue excludes sales and usage ‑based taxes where it has been determined that we are acting as a pass ‑through \n",
      "agent.\n",
      "Advertising\n",
      "Advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party \n",
      "affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with \n",
      "advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken \n",
      "by our users.\n",
      "We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are \n",
      "delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of \n",
      "action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. In general, we report advertising \n",
      "revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is \n",
      "evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. For revenue \n",
      "generated from arrangements that involve third-party publishers, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent, and \n",
      "for those advertising revenue arrangements where we are the agent, we recognize revenue on a net basis.\n",
      "We may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and \n",
      "certain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration \n",
      "when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these amounts and reduce revenue based on the amounts \n",
      "expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable \n",
      "consideration.\n",
      "Reality Labs Revenue\n",
      "RL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, Facebook  Portal,  and \n",
      "wearables , and related software and content.  Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products  is transferred to \n",
      "customers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the consideration RL expects to be entitled to \n",
      "in exchange for the products.\n",
      "Other Revenue\n",
      "Other revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure  and revenue from \n",
      "various other sources.\n",
      "Deferred Revenue and Deposits\n",
      "Deferred revenue and deposits mostly consists of billings and payments we receive from marketers in advance of \n",
      "revenue recognition, revenue not yet recognized for unspecified software upgrades and updates for various RL products. \n",
      "Deposits relate to unused balances held on behalf of our users who primarily use these balances to make purchases in games \n",
      "on our platform. Once the unused balance is utilized by a user, the majority of this amount would then be payable to the \n",
      "developer and the balance would be recognized as revenue. The increase in the deferred revenue and deposits balance for the \n",
      "year ended December 31, 2021 was driven by cash payments from customers in advance of satisfying our performance \n",
      "obligations in RL sales and advertising revenue, offset by revenue recognized that was included in the deferred revenue \n",
      "balance at the beginning of the period.\n",
      "Our payment terms vary by the products or services offered. The term between billings and when payment is due is not \n",
      "significant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are \n",
      "delivered to the customer.\n",
      "Practical Expedients and Exemptions\n",
      "We expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded \n",
      "within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income.\n",
      "86We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length \n",
      "of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for \n",
      "services performed.\n",
      "Cost of Revenue\n",
      "Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These \n",
      "include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from \n",
      "servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based \n",
      "compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs \n",
      "associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing \n",
      "customer transactions; RL cost of products sold; and content costs.\n",
      "Content Costs\n",
      "Our content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to \n",
      "increase engagement on the platform. For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available \n",
      "for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not \n",
      "material to date.\n",
      "For licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. Expensed content costs are \n",
      "included in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of income.\n",
      "Software Development Costs\n",
      "Software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be \n",
      "marketed or sold to external users, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is \n",
      "typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\n",
      "Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and \n",
      "applications used to deliver our services. These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the \n",
      "preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to \n",
      "perform the function intended.\n",
      "Development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.\n",
      "Share-based Compensation\n",
      "Share-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to \n",
      "employees are measured based on the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. \n",
      "Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period. \n",
      "We account for forfeitures as they occur.\n",
      "Income Taxes\n",
      "We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is \n",
      "required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating \n",
      "uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\n",
      "We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using \n",
      "the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected \n",
      "future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as \n",
      "for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to \n",
      "apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We \n",
      "recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment.\n",
      "87We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than \n",
      "not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, \n",
      "expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the \n",
      "need for a valuation allowance. \n",
      "We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax \n",
      "position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These \n",
      "uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate \n",
      "arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an \n",
      "assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will \n",
      "be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and \n",
      "penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make \n",
      "adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, \n",
      "such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is \n",
      "different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such \n",
      "determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. \n",
      "Advertising Expense\n",
      "Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on the consolidated \n",
      "statements of income. We incurred advertising expenses of $2.99 billion, $2.26 billion, and $1.57 billion for the years ended \n",
      "December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n",
      "Cash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted Cash\n",
      "Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of \n",
      "90 days or less from the date of purchase.\n",
      "We hold investments in marketable securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency \n",
      "securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale (AFS) \n",
      "investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current operations. Our AFS \n",
      "investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, included in accumulated \n",
      "other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of \n",
      "estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. \n",
      "Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a charge in interest and other income, net on our \n",
      "consolidated statements of income, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other \n",
      "comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. The amounts of credit losses recorded for the years ended December 31, \n",
      "2021 and 2020 were not material. There was no impairment charge for any unrealized losses in 2019. We determine realized \n",
      "gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method and include such gains or losses in interest \n",
      "and other income, net on the consolidated statements of income.\n",
      "We also maintain a multi-currency notional cash pool for our participating entities with a third-party bank provider. \n",
      "Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. We classify \n",
      "the overdraft balances within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. \n",
      "We classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the \n",
      "consolidated balance sheets based upon the term of the remaining restrictions.\n",
      "Equity Investments  \n",
      "Our equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily determinable \n",
      "fair values. We elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less \n",
      "any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the \n",
      "same issuer as of the respective transaction dates. The change in carrying value, if any, is recognized in interest and other \n",
      "income, net on our consolidated statements of income. We periodically review our equity investments for impairment. If \n",
      "88indicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying amount, we will write down the \n",
      "investment to fair value. \n",
      "In addition, we also held equity investments accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial as of \n",
      "December 31, 2021 and 2020. \n",
      "Fair Value Measurements\n",
      "We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are \n",
      "recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair value as the price that \n",
      "would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at \n",
      "the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be \n",
      "recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-\n",
      "based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks \n",
      "inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following \n",
      "hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the \n",
      "hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\n",
      "Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n",
      "Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices \n",
      "for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by \n",
      "observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n",
      "Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that market \n",
      "participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\n",
      "Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy \n",
      "because their fair value is derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable \n",
      "market inputs.\n",
      "Our equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring \n",
      "basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions occur, the respective equity \n",
      "investment would be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a \n",
      "combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, \n",
      "rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. \n",
      "Accounts Receivable and Allowances\n",
      "Accounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential \n",
      "uncollectible amounts. We make estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit losses and \n",
      "allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors, including historical experience, the age of \n",
      "the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable \n",
      "forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. Expected \n",
      "credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. As of \n",
      "December 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowances for accounts receivable were immaterial. \n",
      "Property and Equipment\n",
      "Property and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, which are amortized, are stated at cost \n",
      "less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the \n",
      "assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\n",
      "89The estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use assets are \n",

      "Buildings 25 to 30 years\n",
      "Equipment and other One to 25 years\n",
      "Finance lease right-of-use assets Three to 20 years\n",
      "Leasehold improvements Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\n",
      "We evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or \n",
      "circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the \n",
      "carrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable, and the asset's fair value is less than the carrying \n",
      "amount, an impairment charge is recognized. We have not recorded any material impairment charges during the years \n",
      "presented. \n",
      "The useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially \n",
      "recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful lives represents \n",
      "the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due \n",
      "to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and \n",
      "technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying \n",
      "amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life. See \n",

      "network assets.\n",
      "Servers and network assets include property and equipment mostly in our data centers, which is used to support \n",
